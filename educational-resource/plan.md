## By Disability Type *(-> `types/`)*

### Vision *(-> `types/vision.md`)*

### Vision

#### Screen readers  
Access text content. JAWS is the most feature-rich but expensive; NVDA is free and highly capable; VoiceOver and Narrator are good built-in options. The future is in AI-driven context, smarter navigation, and making these tools more affordable and intuitive.

##### JAWS (Job Access With Speech)
- Overview: Commercial Windows screen reader by Freedom Scientific.
- Features:
  - Reads text aloud from applications, web pages, and documents.
  - Braille display support.
  - Powerful scripting for custom app accessibility.
  - OCR for reading images and scanned PDFs.
  - Advanced navigation for tables, forms, and complex web content.
- Price: ~$95/year (home license), or ~$1,000 for a perpetual license. Discounts for students/educators.
- How Users Use It: Keyboard shortcuts to navigate, read, and interact with all elements on screen. Used for work, study, and daily computing.
- Gaps/Future Needs:
  - High cost is a barrier.
  - Steep learning curve for beginners.
  - Needs better AI-driven context awareness (e.g., summarizing complex layouts, describing images in detail). cost barrier, steep learning curve, AI context awareness.

##### NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access)
- Overview: Free, open-source screen reader for Windows, developed by NV Access.
- Key Features:
  - Reads text from most Windows apps and browsers.
  - Braile display support.
  - Regular updates and strong community support.
  - Extensible via add-ons.
- Price: Free (donation-supported).
- How Users Use It: Similar to JAWS—keyboard navigation, customizable settings, and add-ons for extra features.
- Gaps/Future Needs:
  - Slightly less robust with complex enterprise apps (e.g., some Office features).
  - Lacks some advanced scripting/customization found in JAWS.
  - Could benefit from more AI-powered features (e.g., image description, smart navigation).
##### Other Tools (VoiceOver, Narrator, Orca)
- VoiceOver (macOS/iOS) : Built-in on Apple devices.
  - Features: Touch and gesture navigation, Braille support, reads everything on screen.
  - Price: Free with Apple devices.
  - Gaps: Less customizable than JAWS/NVDA, but highly usable for most tasks.
- Narrator (Windows) Built-in on Windows 10/11.
  - Features: Basic screen reading, improved in recent versions, supports Braille.
  - Price: Free.
  - Gaps: Still less powerful than JAWS/NVDA for advanced users.
- Orca (Linux)  Open-source for Linux desktops.
  - Features: Reads text, supports Braille, works with many Linux apps.
  - Price: Free.
  - Gaps: Varies in quality depending on Linux distribution and app support.

#### Accessible e-readers  
Users want better format support, richer navigation, improved image accessibility, reliable Braille integration, and more affordable devices. Here are common user complaints about accessible e-readers:
  - Limited Book Formats: Not all e-books are available in accessible formats (e.g., some DRM-protected or image-based PDFs are not readable).
  - Inconsistent Accessibility: Some e-reader apps or devices have incomplete screen reader or Braille support, especially for navigation, bookmarks, or highlighting.
  - Complex Navigation: Moving between chapters, footnotes, or searching text can be cumbersome with screen readers.
  - Poor Image/Graph Accessibility: Figures, charts, and images often lack alt text or descriptions, making them inaccessible.
  - Sync Issues: Notes, highlights, or reading position may not sync well across devices, especially with Braille displays.
  - Limited Braille Support: Some devices or apps do not support all Braille displays or advanced Braille features.
  - Voice Quality: Text-to-speech voices may sound robotic or be hard to understand for long reading sessions.
  - Cost: Specialized Braille e-readers and hardware are expensive and not widely available.
  - Regional Restrictions: Some accessible libraries (like Bookshare or NLS BARD) are only available in certain countries.

## Use Cases

### Work-Related Use Cases

#### Preparing Presentations Independently
- **Challenge**: Creating/formatting slides required days and visual help.
- **Solution**: Write script in Word, use Copilot in PowerPoint to generate slides.
- **Prompts**:  
  - “Create a presentation with 50 slides based on this document.”  
  - “Illustrate with graphs and use a cartoon style.”
- **Outcome**: Fully accessible, formatted slides with notes, tables, visuals—no external help needed.



### Home and Daily Life Scenarios

#### Image Recognition with AI
- **Example**: Take a picture of the kitchen, ask “What’s in this image?” or “What brand is the oven?” (AI: “It’s a SAMSUNG oven.”)
- **Tool**: Be My Eyes AI

#### Reading Labels and Receipts
- **Prompts**:  
  - “Can you read this prescription for me?”  
  - “Can you tell me the value on this receipt?”
- **Tool**: Be My Eyes

#### Reading Printed Text
- **Tool**: Seeing AI
- **Action**: Point phone at document, AI guides framing and reads aloud.

#### Indoor Navigation
- **Use case**: Navigate hotels, restaurants, elevators using phone camera and AI.
- **Prompts**:  
  - “Where is the restaurant from here?”  
  - “Which way to the elevator?”
- **Tool**: Be My Eyes + Hilton integration

#### Hypothetical/Future Scenarios
- **Cooking Guidance**:  
  - “What ingredients are on the table?”  
  - “I want to make pasta—what’s next?”  
  - Conversational, real-time guidance as a personal tutor.

- **Outfit Matching**:  
  - “Can I wear this T-shirt with these pants and these shoes?”  
  - AI gives fashion feedback or suggestions.

## Unmet Needs & Future Possibilities

- **Advanced reading workflows** for scientists (skimming, referencing, jumping between sections). Currently, OCR and screen readers are limited to reading text in graphs. True accessibility for statistical graphs requires authors to include descriptive text and, ideally, provide underlying data in accessible formats. AI solutions for automatic graph interpretation are in early stages and not yet reliable for critical scientific content.
- **AI for daily tasks**: Cooking, matching outfits, organizing spaces.
- **Assistive GPS/navigation** for indoor environments (hotels, offices).
- **Better video content description**: AI describes visual cues (“click here”, “go there”).
- **Social support and peer connection** for people newly experiencing disability.
- **Creating Accessible Training Content** :
  - Co-developed materials for people with disabilities to learn:
    - Accessibility features in Windows, Word, Excel, etc.
    - Using Copilot tailored for different disabilities (visual, hearing, cognitive).
  - **Goal**: Empower users to increase productivity through adaptive AI.

## Legal & Standards Overview

Accessibility is governed by international and regional standards and laws. Key frameworks include:

- **WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines):** The global standard for web accessibility, developed by the W3C. [WCAG Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
- **ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act):** U.S. law prohibiting discrimination based on disability, including digital accessibility. [ADA Overview](https://www.ada.gov/)
- **Section 508 (U.S.):** Requires federal agencies to make electronic and information technology accessible. [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/)
- **European Accessibility Act (EAA):** EU directive requiring products and services (including digital) to be accessible by 2025. [EAA Overview](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1202)
- **EN 301 549:** European standard for ICT accessibility, referenced by the EAA. [EN 301 549](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/)

**How They Relate:**
- WCAG is the technical foundation for most laws and standards worldwide, including ADA, Section 508, and EN 301 549.
- ADA and Section 508 are U.S.-specific, while EAA and EN 301 549 apply in Europe.
- The EAA harmonizes accessibility requirements across EU member states, referencing EN 301 549 and WCAG.
- Compliance with these standards ensures digital products are accessible to people with disabilities and reduces legal risk.

**Localization & Multilingual Access:**  
Many standards require information to be accessible in multiple languages and formats. This hub aims to provide resources and guidance for global audiences.
