### Work-Related Use Cases

#### Preparing Presentations Independently
- **Challenge**: Creating/formatting slides required days and visual help.
- **Solution**: Write script in Word, use Copilot in PowerPoint to generate slides.
- **Prompts**:  
  - “Create a presentation with 50 slides based on this document.”  
  - “Illustrate with graphs and use a cartoon style.”
- **Outcome**: Fully accessible, formatted slides with notes, tables, visuals—no external help needed.
