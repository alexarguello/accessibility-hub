## â™¿ Accessibility Hub Overview

An open-source, AI-powered knowledge base that centralizes accessibility tools and practices, maps unmet needs, and fosters collaboration between people with disabilities and the developers who build inclusive technology.

### ðŸŒŸ Purpose â€” Who this is for

- People with disabilities and caregivers: discover tools that support independent reading, communication, daily life, learning, and work.
- Developers, designers, and product teams: find standards, APIs, checklists, and real gaps that need solutions.
- Educators and researchers: explore curated resources, case studies, and future opportunities.

### ðŸŽ¯ Mission

Bridge the gap between accessibility needs and inclusive technology by:
- Mapping existing tools and resources
- Identifying unmet needs and engineering gaps
- Enabling collaboration and contribution across the community
