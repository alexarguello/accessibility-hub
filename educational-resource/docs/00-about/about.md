A brief introduction to the Accessibility HUB, its history, and the founderâ€™s motivation.  
**Mission:** To empower people with disabilities and developers to co-create accessible digital solutions.  
1. Audience ([PEOPLE])
   People with disabilities
   Caregivers

2. Top-of-Mind Problem ([THAT])
   People with disabilities and caregivers face a lack of consolidated, accessible, and personalized information, practical tools, and supportive communities. This leads to barriers in independence, confidence, daily life management, emotional well-being, and access to opportunities for personal and professional growth.

3. Your Solution ([THIS])
   Provide access to trusted, curated resources, practical guides, and supportive communities, along with AI-powered tools and search features that help people with disabilities and caregivers easily find tailored solutions, learn new skills, and connect with others, empowering them to overcome daily challenges, gain independence, and actively shape more accessible and inclusive environments


I help people with disabilities and caregivers find, use, and share trusted, curated resources, supportive communities, and AI-powered tools for independent reading, learning, daily life, and work, so they can overcome everyday challenges, gain confidence and independence, and actively shape more accessible and inclusive environments for all.
**Vision:** A world where technology is barrier-free for everyone.
