## What is Visual Impairment? üåü

Visual impairment refers to a significant loss of vision that cannot be corrected fully with glasses, contact lenses, medication, or surgery. It includes both partial and complete blindness.

## Types of Visual Impairments üîç

### 1. **Low Vision**
- **Definition**: Partial sight that interferes with daily activities.
- **Characteristics**: Difficulty reading, recognizing faces, or seeing in low light.
- **Support**: Magnifiers, large print materials, and screen readers.

### 2. **Complete Blindness**
- **Definition**: Total lack of vision, including the inability to perceive light.
- **Note**: This is rare; most people retain some light perception.

### 3. **Legal Blindness**
- **Definition**: Visual acuity of 20/200 or worse in the better eye with correction, or a visual field of 20 degrees or less.
- **Implication**: Qualifies for disability benefits and support services.

### 4. **Congenital Blindness**
- **Definition**: Blindness present at birth.
- **Causes**: Genetic conditions, birth defects, or prenatal infections.

### 5. **Cortical Visual Impairment (CVI)**
- **Definition**: Vision loss due to brain damage, not eye damage.
- **Common in**: Children with neurological conditions.
- **Features**: Light-gazing, visual latency, and difficulty with visual complexity.

### 6. **Color Vision Deficiency (Color Blindness)**
- **Definition**: Difficulty distinguishing certain colors.
- **Types**: Red-green, blue-yellow, and total color blindness (achromatopsia).
- **Note**: Not a form of blindness but a visual processing difference.

### 7. **Nutritional Blindness**
- **Cause**: Vitamin A deficiency.
- **Symptoms**: Night blindness, dry eyes, and corneal damage.

### 8. **Acquired Blindness**
- **Definition**: Vision loss due to injury, disease, or aging.
- **Examples**: Diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, macular degeneration.
