#### Screen readers
Access text content. JAWS is the most feature-rich but expensive; NVDA is free and highly capable; VoiceOver and Narrator are good built-in options. The future is in AI-driven context, smarter navigation, and making these tools more affordable and intuitive.

##### JAWS (Job Access With Speech)
- Overview: Commercial Windows screen reader by Freedom Scientific.
- Features:
  - Reads text aloud from applications, web pages, and documents.
  - Braille display support.
  - Powerful scripting for custom app accessibility.
  - OCR for reading images and scanned PDFs.
  - Advanced navigation for tables, forms, and complex web content.
- Price: ~$95/year (home license), or ~$1,000 for a perpetual license. Discounts for students/educators.
- How Users Use It: Keyboard shortcuts to navigate, read, and interact with all elements on screen. Used for work, study, and daily computing.
- Gaps/Future Needs:
  - High cost is a barrier.
  - Steep learning curve for beginners.
  - Needs better AI-driven context awareness (e.g., summarizing complex layouts, describing images in detail).

##### NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access)
- Overview: Free, open-source screen reader for Windows, developed by NV Access.
- Key Features:
  - Reads text from most Windows apps and browsers.
  - Braile display support.
  - Regular updates and strong community support.
  - Extensible via add-ons.
- Price: Free (donation-supported).
- How Users Use It: Similar to JAWSâ€”keyboard navigation, customizable settings, and add-ons for extra features.
- Gaps/Future Needs:
  - Slightly less robust with complex enterprise apps (e.g., some Office features).
  - Lacks some advanced scripting/customization found in JAWS.
  - Could benefit from more AI-powered features (e.g., image description, smart navigation).

##### Other Tools (VoiceOver, Narrator, Orca)
- VoiceOver (macOS/iOS): Built-in on Apple devices.
  - Features: Touch and gesture navigation, Braille support, reads everything on screen.
  - Price: Free with Apple devices.
  - Gaps: Less customizable than JAWS/NVDA, but highly usable for most tasks.
- Narrator (Windows): Built-in on Windows 10/11.
  - Features: Basic screen reading, improved in recent versions, supports Braille.
  - Price: Free.
  - Gaps: Still less powerful than JAWS/NVDA for advanced users.
- Orca (Linux): Open-source for Linux desktops.
  - Features: Reads text, supports Braille, works with many Linux apps.
  - Price: Free.
  - Gaps: Varies in quality depending on Linux distribution and app support.
