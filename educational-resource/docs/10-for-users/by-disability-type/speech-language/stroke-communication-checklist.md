This checklist helps caregivers and professionals assess the communication abilities of individuals recovering from stroke. It supports the selection of appropriate AAC tools and therapy strategies.

### Physical & Sensory Abilities

- Is vision sufficient to see symbols, text, or images?
- Can they hear spoken language or audio prompts?

### Cognitive & Language Abilities
- Can they understand simple spoken instructions?
- Do they recognize familiar people or objects?
- Can they read or identify written words?
- Is memory affected (short-term or long-term)?
- Are they able to make choices or express preferences?

###  Speech & Communication
- Can they speak clearly or at all?
- Do they struggle with word-finding or sentence formation?
- Is their speech fluent or interrupted (e.g., stuttering)?
- Do they show signs of aphasia (expressive or receptive)?

### Emotional & Behavioral Considerations
