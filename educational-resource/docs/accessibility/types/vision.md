### Vision

#### Screen readers  
Access text content. JAWS is the most feature-rich but expensive; NVDA is free and highly capable; VoiceOver and Narrator are good built-in options. The future is in AI-driven context, smarter navigation, and making these tools more affordable and intuitive.

##### JAWS (Job Access With Speech)
- Overview: Commercial Windows screen reader by Freedom Scientific.
- Features:
  - Reads text aloud from applications, web pages, and documents.
  - Braille display support.
  - Powerful scripting for custom app accessibility.
  - OCR for reading images and scanned PDFs.
  - Advanced navigation for tables, forms, and complex web content.
- Price: ~$95/year (home license), or ~$1,000 for a perpetual license. Discounts for students/educators.
- How Users Use It: Keyboard shortcuts to navigate, read, and interact with all elements on screen. Used for work, study, and daily computing.
- Gaps/Future Needs:
  - High cost is a barrier.
  - Steep learning curve for beginners.
  - Needs better AI-driven context awareness (e.g., summarizing complex layouts, describing images in detail). cost barrier, steep learning curve, AI context awareness.

##### NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access)
- Overview: Free, open-source screen reader for Windows, developed by NV Access.
- Key Features:
  - Reads text from most Windows apps and browsers.
  - Braile display support.
  - Regular updates and strong community support.
  - Extensible via add-ons.
- Price: Free (donation-supported).
- How Users Use It: Similar to JAWSâ€”keyboard navigation, customizable settings, and add-ons for extra features.
- Gaps/Future Needs:
  - Slightly less robust with complex enterprise apps (e.g., some Office features).
  - Lacks some advanced scripting/customization found in JAWS.
  - Could benefit from more AI-powered features (e.g., image description, smart navigation).

##### Other Tools (VoiceOver, Narrator, Orca)
- VoiceOver (macOS/iOS) : Built-in on Apple devices.
  - Features: Touch and gesture navigation, Braille support, reads everything on screen.
  - Price: Free with Apple devices.
  - Gaps: Less customizable than JAWS/NVDA, but highly usable for most tasks.
- Narrator (Windows) Built-in on Windows 10/11.
  - Features: Basic screen reading, improved in recent versions, supports Braille.
  - Price: Free.
  - Gaps: Still less powerful than JAWS/NVDA for advanced users.
- Orca (Linux)  Open-source for Linux desktops.
  - Features: Reads text, supports Braille, works with many Linux apps.
  - Price: Free.
  - Gaps: Varies in quality depending on Linux distribution and app support.

#### Accessible e-readers  
Users want better format support, richer navigation, improved image accessibility, reliable Braille integration, and more affordable devices. Here are common user complaints about accessible e-readers:
  - Limited Book Formats: Not all e-books are available in accessible formats (e.g., some DRM-protected or image-based PDFs are not readable).
  - Inconsistent Accessibility: Some e-reader apps or devices have incomplete screen reader or Braille support, especially for navigation, bookmarks, or highlighting.
  - Complex Navigation: Moving between chapters, footnotes, or searching text can be cumbersome with screen readers.
  - Poor Image/Graph Accessibility: Figures, charts, and images often lack alt text or descriptions, making them inaccessible.
  - Sync Issues: Notes, highlights, or reading position may not sync well across devices, especially with Braille displays.
  - Limited Braille Support: Some devices or apps do not support all Braille displays or advanced Braille features.
  - Voice Quality: Text-to-speech voices may sound robotic or be hard to understand for long reading sessions.
  - Cost: Specialized Braille e-readers and hardware are expensive and not widely available.
  - Regional Restrictions: Some accessible libraries (like Bookshare or NLS BARD) are only available in certain countries.
