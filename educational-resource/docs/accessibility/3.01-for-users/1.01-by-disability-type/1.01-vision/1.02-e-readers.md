#### Accessible e-readers
Users want better format support, richer navigation, improved image accessibility, reliable Braille integration, and more affordable devices. Here are common user complaints about accessible e-readers:
  - Limited Book Formats: Not all e-books are available in accessible formats (e.g., some DRM-protected or image-based PDFs are not readable).
  - Inconsistent Accessibility: Some e-reader apps or devices have incomplete screen reader or Braille support, especially for navigation, bookmarks, or highlighting.
  - Complex Navigation: Moving between chapters, footnotes, or searching text can be cumbersome with screen readers.
  - Poor Image/Graph Accessibility: Figures, charts, and images often lack alt text or descriptions, making them inaccessible.
  - Sync Issues: Notes, highlights, or reading position may not sync well across devices, especially with Braille displays.
  - Limited Braille Support: Some devices or apps do not support all Braille displays or advanced Braille features.
  - Voice Quality: Text-to-speech voices may sound robotic or be hard to understand for long reading sessions.
  - Cost: Specialized Braille e-readers and hardware are expensive and not widely available.
  - Regional Restrictions: Some accessible libraries (like Bookshare or NLS BARD) are only available in certain countries.
