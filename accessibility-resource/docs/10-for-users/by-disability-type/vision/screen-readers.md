# Screen Readers: Your Gateway to Digital Access

> **Screen readers turn text and interface elements into speech or Braille, opening up the digital world for people with vision loss.**

Screen readers are essential tools for millions of users. Whether you‚Äôre a developer, educator, or someone exploring accessibility, understanding these tools is key to building and using inclusive technology.

## Quick Start

- **Windows:** Try [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) (free) or [JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/) (commercial)
- **Mac/iOS:** Use [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision/) (built-in)
- **Linux:** Try [Orca](https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/)
- **Windows Built-in:** [Narrator](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-started-with-narrator-3e3e2b8a-ec8c-4e1c-9b1c-5c6e1a5c7b2e)

Most screen readers can be started with a keyboard shortcut. For example, press `Ctrl+Alt+N` to launch NVDA on Windows (if installed).
