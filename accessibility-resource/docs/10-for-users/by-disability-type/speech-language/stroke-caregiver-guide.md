Supporting a loved one after stroke involves patience, creativity, and knowledge of communication strategies.

### Understand the Impact 🧠
- Stroke may affect speech, comprehension, memory, and motor skills.
- Aphasia can make it hard to speak or understand language.
- Emotional changes like frustration or withdrawal are common.

### Communication Tips 🗣️
- Use short, clear sentences.
- Ask yes/no questions when possible.
- Encourage gestures, drawing, or pointing.
- Repeat or rephrase if needed—don’t rush.

### Tools & Techniques 🧰
- Try AAC apps like Spoken, Constant Therapy, or Tactus Therapy
- Use visual aids: photo albums, labeled objects, or printed routines.
- Create a quiet, distraction-free environment for conversation.

### Emotional Support 🤝
