## Legal & Standards Overview

Accessibility is governed by international and regional standards and laws. Key frameworks include:

- **WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines):** The global standard for web accessibility, developed by the W3C. [WCAG Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
- **ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act):** U.S. law prohibiting discrimination based on disability, including digital accessibility. [ADA Overview](https://www.ada.gov/)
- **Section 508 (U.S.):** Requires federal agencies to make electronic and information technology accessible. [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/)
- **European Accessibility Act (EAA):** EU directive requiring products and services (including digital) to be accessible by 2025. [EAA Overview](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1202)
- **EN 301 549:** European standard for ICT accessibility, referenced by the EAA. [EN 301 549](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/)

**How They Relate:**
- WCAG is the technical foundation for most laws and standards worldwide, including ADA, Section 508, and EN 301 549.
- ADA and Section 508 are U.S.-specific, while EAA and EN 301 549 apply in Europe.
- The EAA harmonizes accessibility requirements across EU member states, referencing EN 301 549 and WCAG.
- Compliance with these standards ensures digital products are accessible to people with disabilities and reduces legal risk.

**Localization & Multilingual Access:**  
Many standards require information to be accessible in multiple languages and formats. This hub aims to provide resources and guidance for global audiences.
